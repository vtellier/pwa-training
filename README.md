My training sessions about progessive web apps.
See [my website for more details](https://vte.io/2020/11/toward-progressive-web-apps/)

The idea here is to practice with the basics of _progessive web apps_ without any framework or fancy boiler plate.

For this, I use only plain #HTML and #Javascript.
